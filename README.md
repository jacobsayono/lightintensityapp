# lightintensityapp

This app analyzes the intensity of light in a red boundary box, plotting the intensity values in real-time for high framerate applications.

Check out the other version of this app, which tracks the location of high light-intensities within the camera view: https://github.com/jacobsayono/id-tag

An application is to use retroreflective tapes that vary in height as it circumferences a cylinder.
Below are 3 controllers: rotating-knob, button-press, and sliding-switch.
We are able to sense the state of the controllers without an external source connected to the object.
